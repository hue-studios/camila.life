# camila.life 1.1.0

> hue project featuring Nuxt.js and Snipcart

This is the first version of camila.life.  The site features vegan and plant-based ingredients, recipes, a plant-based blog, and an e-commerce experience using Snipcart.

The functionality is focused on allowing visitors to create a profile, then save ingredients they want to try in their shopping list.

The future goals are to create an online tribe of members that support and share their recipes with vegan and plant-based ingredients.
